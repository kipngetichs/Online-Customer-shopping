# Task
As a data and business analyst with strong fundamentals in business and marketing strategies, my task is to develop a comprehensive dashboard using Excel. My objective is to consolidate and analyze customer shopping data to provide actionable insights that drive sales and enhance customer engagement. I leverage Excel’s advanced functionalities to visualize key metrics such as customer demographics, purchase behavior, payment methods, and promotional impacts. By analyzing data on revenue, purchase frequency, time spent on the platform, browser usage, and the effectiveness of newsletters and vouchers, I will identify trends and optimize marketing strategies. The dashboard will enable stakeholders to make informed decisions, improving overall sales performance and customer satisfaction.
# Action
To execute this project, I  systematically collect, clean, and organize customer shopping data within Excel. I used Excel one of the popular and powerful data analysis tools, including pivot tables, charts, and conditional formatting, to create a dynamic and interactive dashboard. This will involve aggregating data on customer demographics, purchase dates, values, payment methods, time spent on the platform, browser usage, and the influence of newsletters and vouchers. I  also apply my expertise in business and marketing strategies to interpret the data, uncover trends, and identify key insights. The final dashboard will be designed to be user-friendly, enabling stakeholders to easily monitor performance metrics, track promotional effectiveness, and make data-driven decisions to optimize marketing efforts and enhance customer satisfaction.The Preview of the dashboard is available below.
